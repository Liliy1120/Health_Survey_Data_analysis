# Health_Survey_Data_analysis
This is a data set of state-based "Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)" from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2020. It is from a cross-sectional telephone standardized questionnaire. The data used for this study is from columns PHYSHLTH and RENTHOM1.

Goals

    How many days of poor health did New Yorkers typically have in 2020-2021?,
    How Does physical health Differ Based on whether participant rented or owned a home?,
    Is the Difference Statistically Significant? We look at the null and alternative hypothesis
        Null Hypothesis(h0):There is no difference between average days sick (physhlth) for renters and owners.
        Alternative Hypothesis(h1):There is a difference between average days sick (physhlth) for renters and owners.
    Next Steps: Looking at other features of the data for future exploration.

Project found that typically New Yorkers had around 2.9 to 3.2 days of poor health in 2020-2021. From what the data shows if you Own a home you are less likely to spend more than 6 days in poor health. The majority of participants that owned a home spent 0 days in the last 30 days in poor health. This is showing that people who own homes have fewer days of bad health than those who rent. The p-value is signicantly smaller than the alpha, this means that we will REJECT the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.
